# Vertex.BNetEx

An old BlitzMax networking module, updated to be compatible with BlitzMax-NG.

## Features

Tested on `TNetwork` and `TUDPStream` functionality for Windows (for x86 builds) and Linux (for x64 builds).

`TTCPStream` will not work! It's likely that the ICMP ping function in `TNetwork` will not work either.
